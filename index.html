  <h2>The boys from <i>LIVERPOOL</i></h2>
  <p id="beatles"><strong><u>THE BEATLES</u><br><br> </strong>The Beatles are the <strong>best-selling music act of all time</strong>, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven <i>Grammy Awards</i>, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film <u>Let It Be</u>) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.

  <h2>Talking about my <i>GENERATION</i></h2>
  <p id="who"><strong><u>THE WHO</u><br><br> </strong>The Who are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their classic lineup consisted of  <strong>lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist and singer John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon</strong>. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall Stack, large PA systems, the use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk rock, power pop and mod bands, and their songs are still regularly played. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

  <h2>I can't get no <i>SATISFACTION</i></h2>
  <p id="stones"><strong><u>ROLLING STONES</u><br><br> </strong>The Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
